## My process

- I started with the HTML5 semantics, getting the exact tags or containers for each part or components
- Combine the powers of flexbox and css grid to align and set things according the the design
- Add external css for the reset and fonts
- Use figma as reference by examining each component and knowing their properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I have learn to use the figma mock up and it's components's dimensions as reference in implementing atleast a close representation of the design.

### Continued development

- I would love to learn dynamic linking of fonts and other resources for the assets.
